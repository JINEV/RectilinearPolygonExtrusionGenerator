# RectilinearPolygonExtrusionGenerator
A method for generating crease patterns that fold a rectangular sheet of paper into any rectilinear polygon extrusion with a desired minimum edge-to-edge distance.

Run the code makeModel.py (preferably using the Jupyter extension within VSCode) to design and generate the model.  Make sure to include a padding of one square when designing the rectilinear polygon.
The crease pattern will be exported as an .svg file in the same folder as makeModel.py
